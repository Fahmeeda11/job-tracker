/**
 * The data layer, shared by the API and the worker.
 *
 * Both processes talk to the same MongoDB, so the Mongoose schemas have to live
 * somewhere both can import. Duplicating them in each app would work right up
 * until an index or a field default drifts between the two - at which point the
 * worker writes documents the API cannot read, and nothing tells you until
 * production.
 *
 * Routes and business logic stay in their feature folders inside apps/api. Only
 * the schemas and the connection lifecycle live here.
